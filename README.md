This app fetches annual income statements for AAPL (Apple) and allows users to filter and analyze key metrics.

The API is fetched from financialmodelingprep.com.

# How it works:

1. Fetches data from API and displays in a table.
2. Data can be filtered by date, revenue, and net income.
3. Data can be sorted by date, revenue, and net income.
